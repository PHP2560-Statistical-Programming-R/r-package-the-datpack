Purpose of package: Allow for epidemiologists to use one package to determine and visualize epidemiologic measures. 

Our plan:

1. Identify established packages to combine and merge into our final package. - DONE

2. Write code to create a cohesive package.
  
  2.a. add existing packages
  
  2.a. functions to provide summary statistic visualizations (box plots, histograms, bar plots) - Arielle
 
  2.b. create a map function (state, maybe city, maybe zip) - incorporate time as an argument - Gracie & Katie
    
    2.b.1. within the function, calculate statistic (incidence, prevalence, etc...) using existing packages before mapping
    
    2.b.2. use density
